'''
I is image of varying size, 
H is kernel of varying size. 
Output: convolution result that is displayed. 
'''
def Convolve(I,H):
    return

'''
takes image I as input and outputs copy of image re-sampled
by half the width and height of the input. Remember to 
Gaussian filter the image before reducing it; use separable
1D Gaussian kernels. 
'''
def Reduce(I):
    return

'''
takes image I as input and outputs copy of image expanded,
twice the width and height of the input. '''
def Expand(I):
    return


'''
takes in an image I,
takes in N (int) is the no. of levels. 
'''
def GaussianPyrmaid(I,N):
    return

'''
function which collapses the Laplacian pyramid LI of nlevels 
to generate the original image. Report the error in reconstruction
using image difference.
